# World options that influence little details of how the world works;

# worldoptions.txt is read from ALL active mods, higher priority mods
# overwrite lower priority ones and those overwrite settings in this file.

# Bombers store the coordinates of their nuke target separately, vanilla
# Defcon does not show it. If BomberShowNukeTarget is set to 1, the following 
# changes are made to bomber order rendering:
# - If valid nuke target coordinates are set, they are marked with
#   a red attack line. The navigation target is shown in blue, then.
# - Bombers launched before DEFCON 1 with valid nuke targets mark them
#   red already instead of blue.
# - if a bomber is in SRBM mode and no nuke target has been set yet, 
#   its navigation target turns from blue to yellow so you can still 
#   identify switched bombers. Vanilla Defcon shows the navigation
#   marker as red in those situations.
# A value of 0 returns to the bahaviour of vanilla Defcon.

BomberShowNukeTarget 1

# If these settings are 1, the corresponding units can launch their nukes at
# any spot in range; it they are 0, they can only fire at confirmed targets.
# For plain Defcon feel, disable SubLaunchAnywhere.

# Unit and state properties
################

# All unit types have the following propreties you can customize;
# replace 'Unit' with the unit's name.

# The number of hit points. Each successful gunshot hit takes 1 away,
# nuke hits usually take 10.
# UnitLife 1

# The number of nukes.
# UnitNukeSupply 0

# Moving units have some more:

# movement speed in degrees (longitude/latitude) per 100 seconds
# UnitSpeed 1

# Turn rate; acceleration in degrees (longitude/latitude) per 1000 seconds^2;
# it takes about 15 * UnitSpeed / UnitTurnRate seconds for a 90 degree turn under
# optimal conditions.
# UnitTurnRate 1

# operation range; MAX for infinite
# UnitFuelRange MAX

# States have their own properties. Replace 'Unit' with the unit's name and 'State'
# with the state name (for units with only one state, that name is empty).

# The time it takes for a state to get activated:
# UnitStatePrepareTime 120

# The time it takes for the state's action to be repeated:
# UnitStateReloadTime 30

# Radar range if the unit is in that state:
# UnitStateRadarRange 10

# The combat/nuke range in that state:
# UnitStateActionRange 20

# 1 if the state allows actions, 0 if it doesn't.
# UnitStateIsActionable 0

# 'Ammunition' of that state, how often the state's action can be repeated. 
# Nuke/plane supply. -1 for infinite ammunition.
# UnitStateNumTimesPermitted 10

# DEFCON level this state can become active in first.
# UnitStateDefconPermitted 5

# individual settings: (Those that don't make sense to change, ever, are commented out,

# Plane landing
################

# If this is set to 1, advanced plane landingpad selection code is activated,
# if it is 0, planes greedily go for the closest available pad (bombers without nukes
# prefer pads with supply, though)

PlaneLandingAdvanced 1

# If PlaneLandingInterceptCarriers is on 1, planes landing on moving carriers will head
# for a suitable rendezvous point ahead on the carrier's course. If it is 0, they will
# just fly straight at its current location.

PlaneLandingInterceptCarriers 1

################
# Combat
################

# when planes take off (and other units using guns get placed on the map), they need to wait
# their regular reload time before they can fire their first shot, multiplied by
# ReloadOnSpawn/100. Vanilla Defcon has no such wait, the appropriate value of
# ReloadOnSpawn for that would be 0.

ReloadOnSpawn 100

################
# Automatisms
################

# Sometimes, when units are left to their own devices, they will do suboptimal things
# that need to be correctyed by micromanagement.

# Bombers only fire at targets while landing if this is set to 1.

BomberFireWhileLanding 1

# Fighters always look for targets if this is 1, otherwise only after they reach a waypoint.

FighterAlwaysAutoTarget 1

# If ImpossibleTargetTracking is 1, units will happily fire and follow targets they can't
# possibly harm.

################
# Bugs
################

# Some people like some bugs. Here you can re-enable your favourite ones.

# In vanilla Defcon, ICBMs sometimes prefer to take the longer path round the earth;
# they prefer to cross the map seam. If NukeShortestPath is 0, they still do that. If
# it is 1, they always take the shortest path.

NukeShortestPath 1

# If CarrierNoPursuit is set to 1, fleets with carriers in them never prusue other fleets.
# This makes sense as they don't need to get close to attack and it is often triggered
# involuntarily by sending fighters at enemy ships. If it is 0, carriers don't care.

CarrierNoPursuit 1

# If ImmediateRetarget is set to 1, attack targets and bomber nuke targets can be
# reset even while the state timer is ticking down. If it is 0, the retarget action
# is queued up and will be executed as soon as the timer hits zero.

ImmediateRetarget 1

# If ManualTargetShotLoss is set to 1, manually selecting a target for conventional
# fire will cause one shot that could be fired to be swallowed up like in vanilla Defcon.

ManualTargetShotLoss 0

# If SiloAllowManualTarget is set to 0, silos will override manually set targets
# like vanilla Defcon. Unless ManualTargetShotLoss is at 1 and ImmediateRetarget at 0, you
# still can fire single shots at manually selected targets, though, but only individually.

SiloAllowManualTarget 1

# If InvisibleTargetTracking is 1, sometimes invisible objects will be tracked by former
# attackers and be visible in the orders view.

InvisibleTargetTracking 0
