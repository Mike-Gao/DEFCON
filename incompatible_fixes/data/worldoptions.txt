# World options that influence little details of how the world works;
# they're too fine grained to be game options. Instead, put a modified
# version of this file into a MOD and distribute that.
# worldoptions.txt is read from ALL active mods, higher priority mods
# overwrite lower priority ones and those overwrite settings in this file.
# So if you only want to mod a part of the rules, delete the ones you 
# do not care about.

# Bombers store the coordinates of their nuke target separately, vanilla
# Defcon does not show it. If BomberShowNukeTarget is set to 1, the following 
# changes are made to bomber order rendering:
# - If valid nuke target coordinates are set, they are marked with
#   a red attack line. The navigation target is shown in blue, then.
# - Bombers launched before DEFCON 1 with valid nuke targets mark them
#   red already instead of blue.
# - if a bomber is in SRBM mode and no nuke target has been set yet, 
#   its navigation target turns from blue to yellow so you can still 
#   identify switched bombers. Vanilla Defcon shows the navigation
#   marker as red in those situations.
# A value of 0 returns to the bahaviour of vanilla Defcon.

# Some people like some bugs. Here you can re-enable your favourite ones.

# In vanilla Defcon, ICBMs sometimes prefer to take the longer path round the earth;
# they prefer to cross the map seam. If NukeShortestPath is 0, they still do that. If
# it is 1, they always take the shortest path.
