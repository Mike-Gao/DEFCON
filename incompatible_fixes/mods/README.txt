Naming convention for included mods:
 Just NAME-VERSIONNUMBER, where the version number increases every time 
 you remove a file (so there is no trouble for Windows users who just
 install one version on top of another)
 OR an incompatible change is made in a generally compatible update
 (keep the old version around in this case)
 
 There is no need to up the version number every time a change is made
 in development branches.
