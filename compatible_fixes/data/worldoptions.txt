# World options that influence little details of how the world works;
# they're too fine grained to be game options. Instead, put a modified
# version of this file into a MOD and distribute that.
# worldoptions.txt is read from ALL active mods, higher priority mods
# overwrite lower priority ones and those overwrite settings in this file.
# So if you only want to mod a part of the rules, delete the ones you 
# do not care about.
